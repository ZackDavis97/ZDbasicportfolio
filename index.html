            <p> My name is Zackary Davis. I am a recent college graduate who is looking to make a run at a career in software development. I come from a military family and have always had a knack for adjusting to change. This is important because my college degree is in history and this is a new chapter in my life that could pose more of a challenge to my status quo.</p>
            <p> I am pursuing software development for its challenge and ever changing environment. I would be adament to say I haven't had friends push me in this direction either. But with the challenge and my education background up to this point, I know I am up to whatever could be thrown at me.</p>
            <p> To get to know a little bit more about what I have done so far, check out the links above or my <a href="./Assets/ZackaryDavis_Resume copy.pdf">Resume</a>.</p>

## My Portfolio READ.me

This updated portfolio has added some new features that were not in the previous version from a couple of weeks ago. With the exception of 1/3 of the code, the rest has been changed or deleted in some way. Below is the list of the new editions to the portfolio.

* Instead of the navbar links before, there is new navbar functions that tie to new pages including a contact and portfolio htlm. This cut down on some of the extra code and make the code look clean and simple. 

* In the contact html there is 3 links for my github, linkedin and gmail accounts. These can be accessed by pressing on the coresponding images.

* The portfolio html has a list of the assignments I have worked on so far and can be accessed by clicking on the term for the assignment. They also have a image that relates to the project as a nice visual for people.

* The about me section has been simplified to give a brief insight into me and my background.

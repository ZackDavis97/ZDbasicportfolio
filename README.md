## My Portfolio READ.me

This is my first attempt at making a portfolio of myself. I think it well given I did have some growing pains over the hours. I have made multiple commits to constantly update my repo when code has been added or I caught mistakes.

* Used Hhtml href links to tell the code to move to a specific section of the page. (I.e. the contact button being pressed and going to the contact section of the page)

* An updated picture of me was added to the page to show who I am.

* Each section was split up in the html to give a break, though the css is mostly all together instead of spread out

* Used Lorem (Tab) as a space filler for the time being until further improvements are made to the page

* When the navigation bar buttons are hovered over they will glow pink. This was done in css.
